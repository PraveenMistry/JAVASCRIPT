		Define unescape() and escape() functions?

The escape () function is responsible for coding a string so as to make the transfer of the information from one computer to the other, across a network.

For Example:


<script>
document.write(escape(“Hello? How are you!”));
</script>
<script>
 
document.write(escape(“Hello? How are you!”));
 
</script>
Output: Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21

The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.

It works in the following way. For example:


<script>
document.write(unescape(“Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21”));
</script>
<script>
 
document.write(unescape(“Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21”));
 
</script>
Output: Hello? How are you!
	</p>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
	document.write(escape(“Hello? How are you!”)); //encoding
	document.write(unescape(“Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21”)); // decoding
</script>
