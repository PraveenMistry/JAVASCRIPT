	 		The output would be 0. The delete operator is used to delete properties from an object.
	 			Here x is not an object but a local variable. delete operators don't affect local variables.<br><br>

				var b = (function(){<br>
				    delete a;<br>
				    return a;<br>
				  })();<br>
				  <br>
				  console.log(b);<br>
	 		</code><br><br>
	 		The output would be 1. The delete operator is used to delete the property of an object. Here x is not an object, but rather it's the global variable of type number.<br><br>

	 	<li>
	 		<code>
	 			var x = { foo : 1};<br>
				var y = (function(){<br>
				    delete x.foo;<br>
				    return x.foo;<br>
				})();<br>
				  <br>
				console.log(y);<br>
	 		</code><br><br>
	 		The output would be undefined. The delete operator is used to delete the property of an object. Here, x is an object which has the property foo, and as it is a self-invoking function, we will delete the foo property from object x. After doing so, when we try to reference a deleted property foo, the result isundefined.<br><br>
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
	 		<code>
	 			var Employee = {<br>
				  company: 'xyz'<br>
				}<br>
				
				var emp1 = Object.create(Employee);<br>
				delete emp1.company<br>
				console.log(emp1.company);<br>
	 		</code><br><br>
	 		The output would be xyz. Here, emp1 object has company as its prototype property. The delete operator doesn't delete prototype property.
	 		<br>
			emp1 object doesn't have company as its own property. You can test it console.log(emp1.hasOwnProperty('company')); //output : false. However, we can delete the company property directly from theEmployee object using delete Employee.company. Or, we can also delete the emp1 object using the __proto__ property delete emp1.__proto__.company.
