	</code>
	<p>
		Not only is this surprising, but what makes this particularly gnarly is that foo2() returns undefined without any error being thrown.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason for this has to do with the fact that semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript (although omitting them is generally really bad form). As a result, when the line containing the return statement (with nothing else on the line) is encountered in foo2(), a semicolon is automatically inserted immediately after the return statement.

	</p>
	<p>
		No error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid, even though it doesnâ€™t ever get invoked or do anything (it is simply an unused code block that defines a property bar which is equal to the string "hello").

	</p>
	<p>
		This behavior also argues for following the convention of placing an opening curly brace at the end of a line in JavaScript, rather than on the beginning of a new line. As shown here, this becomes more than just a stylistic preference in JavaScript.
